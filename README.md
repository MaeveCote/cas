# Computer Algebra System (CAS) in C#
## Overview
This is a personnal project built in C# that aims to dive deep into the inner algorithms of *Computer Algebra Systems* (CAS). 
These software have been fascinating me for a while and I wanted to understand how these apps managed to manipulate algebraic equations as if humans did.

The system is inspired by tools like *Symbolab* or *WolframAlpha*, with a focus on learning, precision, extensibility and maintainability.

## Symbolic manipulation structure
A *Computer Algebra System* (CAS) or *Symbolic Calculator* is a software that allows users to manupulate mathematical expressions in ways that ressembles the human algebraic manipulations. 
These calculators can be vary useful in computing convoluted equations and to shorten long manual computations.
